# vse-carslab-hub
A repository for deploying Openshift clusters with ACM and Argo CD.  
All cluster lifecycle is managed by Argo CD, including Argo configuration itself.

## How to run it
```shell
until oc apply -k https://github.com/redhat-partner-solutions/vse-carslab-hub/bootstrap/overlays/default; do sleep 3; done
```

# Structure
|#|Directory Name|Description|
|---|----------------|-----------------|
| 1. | `bootstrap` | This is where openshift-gitops configurations is stored. These are the items that get the cluster/automation started. <br /><br /> `base` is where are the "common" YAML would live and `overlays` are configurations specific to the cluster. |
| 2. | `components` | This is where specific components for the GitOps Controller lives (in this case Argo CD).<br /><br />`applicationsets` is where all the ApplicationSets YAMLs live.<br /><br />Other things that can live here are RBAC, Git repo, and other Argo CD specific configurations (each in their repsective directories). |
| 3. | `core` | This is where YAML for the core functionality of the cluster live. Here is where the Kubernetes administrator will put things that is necissary for the functionality of the cluster.<br /><br />Under `gitops-controller` is where you are using Argo CD to manage itself. The `kustomization.yaml` file uses `bootstrap/overlays/default` in it's `bases` configuration. This `core` directory gets deployed as an applicationset which can be found under `components/applicationsets/core-components-appset.yaml`.<br /><br />To add a new "core functionality" workload, one needs to add a directory with some yaml in the `core` directory. See the `advanced-cluster-management` directory as an example.|
| 4. | `clusters` | This is where the new clusters configuration is stored. <br /><br /> To add a new workload cluster, one needs to add a directory with some yaml in the `overlays` directory. See the `blazer` directory as an example.|
| 5. | `add-workers` | This is where the configuration to add day2 workers is stored. <br /><br /> To add a day2 worker node to a cluster add the yamls to `add-workers\du3-ldc1\overlay\cluster-name`. See the `add-workers\du3-ldc1\overlay\volante` for an example.|
